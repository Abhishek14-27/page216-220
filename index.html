critical systems heuristics were used. The most important outcome was that, whilst the
extent to which the five organisations involved shared information and knowledge was
very variable, there were no perceived barriers to this happening. Such sharing,
despite considerable structural and cultural barriers, was seen to be feasible both
organisationally and technically. The study further highlighted a need to more closely
integrate operational and strategic planning in this area and to make more explicit
use of known and tested methodologies to better enable participative dialogue.</i></div>
            <img style="padding-left: 120px" src ="img1.png">
            <div>This chapter is based on a study into the feasibility of sharing caller information
undertaken by the authors during 2000/2001. It involved Barfordshire Ambulance and
Paramedic Service NHS Trust, Fire and Rescue Service, and Police Service, all in the UK,
as participants. Whilst it might be construed that the only “healthcare group” included
was the Ambulance and Paramedic Service, our study indicated that much of the work
of all emergency services falls into or is related to healthcare. For example, fire crews and
police frequently act as “first responders” to accidents in which they give support to
ambulance and paramedic staff. Fire and police officers receive first aid training, and in
some parts of the UK police are beginning to be trained to use defibrillators. The
boundary between these three services as regards issues of healthcare is becoming, it
would seem, ever more blurred.</div>
            <div>The study began with all five services named above as participants. However, in practice,
the participation of the Fire and Rescue Service was restricted to mostly Principal Officer
level, and the project team has augmented information from that source by visits to similar
organisations and IT suppliers, and by the collection of secondary data. There were good
reasons for this lower level of involvement on the part of the Fire service, and these will
be addressed later in the chapter.</div>
            <div>Further, the outcome of the May 2000 Home Office Report (The Future of Fire Service
Control Rooms and Communications in England and Wales, HM Fire Service Inspectorate, 2000), which came in the middle of the study, marked the effective withdrawal of
Barfordshire Fire and Rescue Service from operational involvement in the study.</div><br>

feasibility of enhancing sharing and exchange of caller information between the above,
